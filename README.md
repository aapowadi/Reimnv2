# Reimnv2
Research on using riemannian geodesics to improve 6-DoF pose estimation. (Tensorflow 2.4.1)  (Model Subclassing API)

Date: 3-15-21

1) Built the Encoder-Decoder to get the outlines of the object (Segmentation).

Next Steps

1) To build the pose regressor and reimannian loss function.
2) Test on real-life data.
